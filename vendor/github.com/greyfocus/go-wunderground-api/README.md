# Golang wrapper for Wunderground API

Wunderground.com exposes some of their data through an JSON or XML API and they
also provide a free API key, with some limitations. If you enjoy making things
or just have an app idea, it can be a very good source of weather data with
global coverage.

## Status

This wrapper is still work in progress - at the moment it provides support only
for the local conditions. It should be quite easy to extend it though if you
need some features.

## Requirements
* Go 1.6 (it may work with other versions)
* [Wunderground API Key](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/)

## Basic Usage

TODO

For the time being, be sure to check the sample command line app provided in
`main.go`.

## Notice

This project is not affiliated with [Wunderground.com](http://wundeground.com).
Be sure to check with them regarding the license and terms of conditions for the
API.
